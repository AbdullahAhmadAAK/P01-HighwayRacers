# Highway Racers Submission Repo

An Android-based endless runner, built using Unity 3D as part of our Final Year Project at Lahore University of Management Sciences. The game itself features a motorcyclist maneuvering his way through traffic and obstacles, picking up powerups, coins and fuels and evading the police for as long as he can. This repo also has submission documents.

This is the submission repo for our final year project. I was the team lead and managed the distribution of the work, as well as building the core bike dynamics and start game/end game screens. I also religiously studied the texts assigned to us by [Mindstorm Labs](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mindstorm-studios), our mentors, for improving our understanding of game development.
