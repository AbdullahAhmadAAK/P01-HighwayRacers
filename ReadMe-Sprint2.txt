
SPRINT-2 SUBMISSION GUIDELINES
1. Properly tested working system deployed on an online hosting platform.2. Code with readable comments uploaded in “Development/Sprint-2” folder of your project’s Github repository.3. 3-4 minutes video that explains the functionality of your system developed so far. This must be uploaded in “Sprint-1” folder of your project’s Github repository.4. Updated architecture and data model must be uploaded in the respective folders on Github.5. Test case execution report. Create the test cases document and update the same document with testing result.6. Update project schedule on Github. The following two views must be available in Github (a) A table view where use cases are grouped according to Sprints (Sprints view) (c) A board view that reflects the status of development (completed, in progress, to be done).  7. This "Readme" file should be uploaded in Sprint-1 folder. 8. Bonus: automate testing of 1 use case using your selected testing tool. For instance, automate using Selenium or any other tool that you have selected.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
<Any additional information that you would like me to know>
1. we faced merging issues with github so video of gameplay will be provided. Will be using SourceTree for next sprint.2. some features* were not completed or discarded by Mindstorm studio for this sprint which includes;     a. game economy; collection of coins    b. powerups; invibility of bike and magnet to collect all coins     *these features will be implemented the next sprint along with other planned features.  
3. Compression of game; size of game will be reduced to make it more suitable for mobile.
